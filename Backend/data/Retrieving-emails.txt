Get new emails
Unipile's API give you two options to receive emails in your application
In realtime with Webhooks
The recommended approach to listen for new messages in your application is by using a Webhook
because they trigger in real time. Whenever the user account receives or sends a new email, the Webhook
will call your specified URL with the given email that you can store to be displayed.

With a cron job
If your system cannot handle Webhooks, or if you don't need real time, you can create a cron job calling
GET /emails Method at interval.
We advise fetching a larger period than your cron delay to account for any potential disconnects or errors
that may result in losing outdated emails. In this case, implementing a unique ID verification on your history
entry based on the email ID can help prevent duplicate entries.
