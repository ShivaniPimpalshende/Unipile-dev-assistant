  📘     Calendar permissions are not enabled by default on your Unipile account. You need to activate
        the relevant scopes in the Settings section of your dashboard and reconnect your account to
        grant these permissions before you can use these API requests..




Get calendars
To get existing emails, use the GET calendars Method .
  curl --request GET \
       --url https://{YOUR_DSN}/api/v1/calendars?limit=10&account_id=5D586za6a-aAaasqXX \
       --header 'X-API-KEY: {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
       --header 'accept: application/json'


This method use pagination.


Get events
Unipile's API give you two options to retrieve events in your application


In realtime with Webhooks
The recommended approach to listen for event in your application is by using a Webhook because they
trigger in real time. Whenever the user account create or update a calendar event, the Webhook will call
your specified URL with the given calendar event that you can store to be displayed.
With a cron job
If your system cannot handle Webhooks, or if you don't need real time, you can create a cron job calling
GET /events Method at interval.

We advise fetching a larger period than your cron delay to account for any potential disconnects or errors
that may result in losing outdated emails. In this case, implementing a unique ID verification on your history
entry based on the event ID can help prevent duplicate entries.




Create and update events
You can create, update, delete or retrieve an event:

    Create an event
