AUTHENTICATION

Unipile API uses Access Tokens to authenticate requests.
The access token acts as the API key and is managed from the Unipile Dashboard.

Security:
Access tokens carry high privileges and must be kept secure.
They must not be shared publicly or committed to repositories.

DSN:
Each Unipile account has a DSN.
The DSN is used as part of the base API URL.

Base URL format:
https://<YOUR_DSN>/api/v1/...

Authentication Header:
All API requests must include the access token in the request headers.

Header format:
X-API-KEY: <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>

Authentication Methods:
- SDK-based authentication: Token is set once and sent automatically.
- Manual authentication: Token must be included in every request header.

Unauthenticated requests are rejected.
